• Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the
vulnerability.

Tampering is malicious modification of data or systems by unauthorized party. This can lead to compromise in integrity
and trust on the system. Common examples can be data tampering, software tampering, hardware tampering etc.
For example, if a hacker gets a way to induce a kind of trojan horse into systems that randomly starts encrypting files
in the server, it will be an example of data tampering as now state of data on the server after being affected cannot be trusted.
Secure systems implement stronger authentication and access controls, cryptographic techniques to detect any unauthorized modification in data,
secure communication protocols like HTTPS,SSH etc. These mechanisms make it harder for the attacker to get unauthorized data
as well as helps detect tampering quickly so necessary action can be taken to prevent any damage from it.


• Which CIA property does tampering violate?

Tampering primarily violates the Integrity property of the CIA.
Confidentiality may be violated if the tampering allows unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Availability could be impacted if the tampering disrupts system operations or enables denial-of-service attacks.
