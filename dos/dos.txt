- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability:

Denial of Service (DoS) is a vulnerability where an attacker overwhelms a system with requests/traffic, exhausting
resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users. The secure version prevents this by implementing rate limiting,
input validation, resource isolation, and robust error handling to mitigate DoS attack vectors.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Additional security mechanisms to prevent DoS attacks include Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to filter malicious traffic,
load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers, DDoS protection services, redundancy and failover mechanisms,
and continuous monitoring and incident response plans.
