Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Information disclosure refers to the unintended or unauthorized exposure of sensitive data or system details that could
potentially be exploited by an attacker. It is a vulnerability that can lead to the compromise of confidential information
or enable further attacks by revealing system internals. The secure version prevents this by implementing input validation,
proper error handling, access controls, secure headers, and encryption.

Which CIA property does tampering violate?

Information disclosure violates the Confidentiality principle of the CIA triad, as it allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

Secure coding training, penetration testing, security monitoring and logging, data classification and protection,
secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC), secure coding libraries, and regular security updates and patching.
By incorporating these mechanisms, the risk of information disclosure vulnerabilities can be significantly reduced,
protecting the confidentiality of sensitive data and system details.
