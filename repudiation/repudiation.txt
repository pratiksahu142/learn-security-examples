- Briefly explain the Repudiation vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.

Repudiation Vulnerability:

Repudiation refers to the ability of an entity to deny or dispute their involvement in a particular action or event.
The secure version is better at preventing repudiation by implementing robust logging, auditing mechanisms, and
strong authentication with non-repudiation (e.g., digital signatures, timestamps).
This ensures that actions and events are accurately recorded, and entities cannot falsely deny their involvement.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

- Regularly archiving and securing audit logs and records to maintain a comprehensive audit trail.
- Enforcing strict access controls and segregation of duties to prevent unauthorized modification or deletion of logs.
