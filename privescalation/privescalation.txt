Briefly explain the Privilege Escalation vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the
vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain higher access privileges than intended, potentially compromising the entire system.
The secure version prevents this by implementing robust access controls, principle of least privilege, secure coding practices
(input validation, proper error handling, etc.), and avoiding hardcoded credentials.

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such
attacks?

- Regular security updates and patching to address known privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
- Separating privileges and enforcing role-based access controls.
- Implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Monitoring and logging user activities to detect suspicious behavior.
- Conducting regular security audits and penetration testing.
