• Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Spoofing is a kind of cyber-attack where one entity impersonates a legitimate entity to take advantage of their rights.
For example, in a banking site, if attacker is able to impersonate a banker, then given right conditions, they can do unauthorised transactions,
share user data, or even bring the bank servers down. It can be of different types, namely, IP spoofing, email spoofing, or DNS spoofing.
It can be prevented by implemented strict security for authentication like biometric or two-factor authentication.
By ensuring strong authentication and encryption measures are in place, secure systems significantly reduce the risk of spoofing attacks.

• Which CIA properties do you think Spoofing violates?

While the main impact is on integrity, some types of spoofing like DNS spoofing can also lead to violation of availability
by enabling denial of service attacks. Confidentiality is generally not directly impacted by spoofing,
unless the spoofed access leads to revelation of sensitive data.
